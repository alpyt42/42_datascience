## Chapter I: Piscine

### What is a Piscine?
A "Piscine" is a series of small, interconnected projects (modules) that introduces participants to various aspects of a programming language, paradigm, or technology. In this case, the focus is on Python. To successfully complete the Piscine, participants are expected to:

- Engage in more than just one or two projects.
- Attempt daily submissions, regardless of completion status.
- Dedicate at least a week's effort.
- Note that each project repository will close automatically after one day.
- Complete peer evaluations within two days for each module.
- Understand that modules can be retried without delay.

**Collaboration is key**: Working in groups is highly recommended to enhance the learning experience.

## Chapter II: Preamble

### Introduction to Python
Contrary to the constricting snakes found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Eastern Hemisphere, our focus is on the Python programming language. Named by Fran√ßois Marie Daudin in 1803, the term 'Python' has evolved to represent a high-level, object-oriented programming language, widely used in data science for its extensive library support.

## Chapter III: Instruction

### Project Completion Guide
To successfully complete this Piscine, participants must sequentially complete the following projects:

- **Python - 0**: Starting
- **Python - 1**: Array
- **Python - 2**: DataTable
- **Python - 3**: OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)
- **Python - 4**: Data-Oriented Design (DoD)

Note:
- Each project must be completed in the given order.
- Registration for a subsequent project requires validation of the previous one.
- Ensure you are registered for this project to access all materials.
- Project modules can be accessed directly through links on the project page or via the list of projects on your intra.
